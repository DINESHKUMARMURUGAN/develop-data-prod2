###mtcars dataset - Description

###Motor Trend Car Road Tests

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

##Exploratory Data Analysis

###Reading the Data

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```
Setting the Factors
```{r}
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))
```

###Getting summary of the Data

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

###Testing for Normality
We will do two test

1. One with ad.test method from nortest package and checking if the p values is greater than 0.05
2. Another by plotting the dataset

####ad.test method
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(nortest)
ad.test(mtcars$mpg)
```
 > p value is greater than 0.05

```{r warning=FALSE,fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r warning=FALSE,fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
plot(d, xlab = "MPG", main ="Density Plot of MPG")
mtrow<-data.frame(mtcars$mpg)
ggplot(mtrow, aes(x=mtrow$mtcars.mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=3)
```
 > Plot looks to be normal distribution
 
###Lets choose the predictors required for the model

Lets create a correlation matrix for all the predictors against **mpg**
```{r warning=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
sort(cor(mtcars)[1,])
```
 - **am** by default is included in the model
 - **wt**, **cyl**, **disp**, and **hp** are highly correlated with **mpg**
 - we also see that **cyl** and **disp** are highly correlated with each other, which we cannot use as a predictor
 
##Performing Regression Analysis

###Simple Linear Regression

```{r}
Simplefit <- lm(mpg~am, data = mtcars)
summary(Simplefit)
```

 - on average, automatic cars have 17.147 MPG and manual transmission cars have 7.245 MPGs more
 - we see that the R^2 value is 0.3598
 - This means that our model only explains 35.98% of the variance
 
###Multivariate Linear Regression
```{r}
Multivariatefit <- lm(mpg~am + wt + hp, data = mtcars)
anova(Simplefit, Multivariatefit)
```
With a p-value of 3.745e-09, we reject the null hypothesis and claim that our multivariate model is significantly different from our simple model. Lets check the residuals before we derive any conclution

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(Multivariatefit)
```
They are normally distributed, so we can report on our final Model
```{r}
summary(Multivariatefit)
```
 - This model explains over 83.99% of the variance.
 - On average, manual transmission cars have 2.084 MPGs more than automatic transmission cars.
